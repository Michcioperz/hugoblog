**Hi, my name is Micha≈Ç Sidor, and I go by Michcioperz on the web.**
I am a programmer and a Computer Science MSc student at
University of Warsaw. I use he/him and they/them pronouns.
Currently I am a Software Engineering Intern at Sentry.io.

**I think the coolest thing about the web and computers is** the way
those technologies encourage people to express themselves
creatively, whether through art, programming, or other
disciplines. Stemming from this belief, I consider it my life
goal to help people create cool things (but also communities), by
providing them with infrastructure and tools.

**Throughout my career** I've mostly been tinkering with web
development (in Python) and server administration. While this
description doesn't fully describe the work I've done for the
[Polish Olympiad in Informatics](https://oi.edu.pl) as a
technical staff, it is accurate enough for the bulk of it.
Recently I'm moving my focus towards systems programming (in Rust
and Zig), which will hopefully show in my work for the [ngSim
project](https://mimuw.edu.pl/~iwanicki/projects/ngSim/) and in
my internship at [Sentry](https://sentry.io). _[Read
more about my past work](./life-changelog)_

**I occasionally ramble about things on my blog** in an attempt to
provoke myself into getting good at writing blog posts. I think
one of the most interesting pieces I've managed to churn out is
[My nuclear take on modular phone design](./post/modular-phones).

I'm open to interesting job offers, as long as "interesting"
doesn't mean Django (which I've grown too tired of at this point)
or blockchain or machine learning (which I am a hopeless disbeliefer in). Of
course, work is not the only thing **I like to be talked to** about! _[See how
best to contact me](./contact)_
