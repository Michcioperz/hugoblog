**Hi, my name is Michalina Sidor, and I go by Michcioperz on the web.**
I am a programmer and a Computer Science MSc student at
University of Warsaw. I use she/her pronouns.

**Throughout my career** I've mostly been tinkering with web
development (in Python) and server administration. While this
description doesn't fully describe the work I've done for the
[Polish Olympiad in Informatics](https://oi.edu.pl) as a
technical staff, it is accurate enough for the bulk of it.

**I occasionally ramble about things on my blog** in an attempt to
provoke myself into getting good at writing blog posts. I think
one of the most interesting pieces I've managed to churn out is
[My nuclear take on modular phone design](./post/modular-phones).

**Talk to me** if you want, but preferably **not** about blockchain or machine learning. _[See how to contact me](./contact)_
