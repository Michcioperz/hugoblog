What is it about?
-----------------

A high schooler solving girls' emotional problems (which cause quantum mechanics phenomena) using witty remarks.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

The character development is great and the movie that concludes the story made me shed a tear.

Honestly, this is a great replacement for _Steins;Gate_. It's shorter, with some similar themes, and much better characters.

Is it safe for work?
--------------------

Haha no way.
