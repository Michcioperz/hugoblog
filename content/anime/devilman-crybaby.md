What is it about?
-----------------

A calm boy becomes host for a demon, and then all hell breaks loose.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

The social commentary. The story in general. You will likely cry by the end.

Is it safe for work?
--------------------

Definitely not. Very drastic and sexual ad nauseam.
