What is it about?
-----------------

An unkillable soldier and an Ainu girl teaming up with some other people to find stolen Ainu gold.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

A fun quirky cast of characters and the blend of adventure and cooking.

Is it safe for work?
--------------------

Mostly, but I think there are a few questionable scenes, and I don't think it's great for children. Not to mention the parts where they eat deer brains and stuff.
