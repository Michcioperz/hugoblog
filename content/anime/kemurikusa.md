### What is it about?

A family punching their way through monsters looking for water in the post-apocalyptic world runs into a boy that can't be killed with their cyber-organic weapons.

It is okay if you have questions at this point.

### What's so great about it?

The world building. The quirky CG 3D imagery.

### Is it safe for work?

Yes.
