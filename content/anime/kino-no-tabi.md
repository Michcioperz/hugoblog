### Okay, but which one?

Both the 2003 and the 2017 series are good. The older one has a raw style comparable to _Serial Experiments Lain_ (with which it shared the director). The newer one is more sparkling and bright. They mostly cover different parts of the source material. If you can't choose, watch both.

### What is it about?

Travelling around the world on a talking motorbike through small countries, with each country having its own specific quirk. Sometimes fighting people.

### What's so great about it?

The world building and the stories that leads to.

### Is it safe for work?

Yes, but the themes are pretty dark, so it's not completely suitable for children.
