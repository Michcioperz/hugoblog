What is it about?
-----------

An young orphan girl coming back from being a berserker kind of trained-to-recklessly-kill soldier at a fantasy version of World War I, and winds up becoming a ghostwriter for people who can't write.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

The story is touching and beautifully told. The music is great. I also might have a sweet tooth for the time period this seems to be inspired by.

Is it safe for work?
--------------------

There's a lot of blood sometimes, and the story is centered around war.
