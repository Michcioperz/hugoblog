What is it?
-----------

A slice of life series about cute girls doing camping things.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

The overwhelming comfiness. And the great comfy soundtrack by Akiyuki Tateyama.

Is it safe for work?
--------------------

I think there's one or two hot springs scenes, but no fan service. That's it.
