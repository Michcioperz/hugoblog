Hi, my name is Michał, and if you are reading this on my website, I am **currently open** for job offers. I will be available full-time-ish starting approximately **October 2022**, and part-time no later than July 2022, probably earlier (depends on uni). I live in Warsaw, Poland for now, but I am quite interested in moving out somewhere I can work remotely from.

### Things I can offer

- I dabbled with a number of programming languages, and I can adapt fast to the development environment
- I am most comfortable writing web services in Rust and Go, while trying but failing to get away from Python/Django
- I know my way around a Linux system, with some refresher I should be able to do embedded programming, and under duress I might even do basic frontend development
- If you leave me with bad or mediocre internal tooling, I may end up fixing or rewriting it out of frustration (examples include turning a set of Bash scripts into a systemctl-style singular tool, bodging a frontend dashboard for a test device farm in Svelte)
- I like understanding the business idea well enough to be able to predict what will be needed later, so that I can choose solutions that will nicely extend in that direction
- I will honestly tell you what I think, including when I think you're wrong, in a respectful manner

### Things I would like to see

You don't have to tick literally all the boxes, it's just some ways to spark my interest in your business:

- programming in languages where the type system provides useful feedback during compilation and not just during runtime (Rust is a good example)
- a contract granting me healthcare and labour protections (under Polish law, that would be umowa o pracę)
- remote-first workflows that reduce time spent in meetings
- fully remote with occassional hangouts in real life
- company hardware (to help maintain proper work-life balance)
- letting me work a bit less than full-time (4 days a week instead of 5)

### Things I am not interested in

You will find me impossible or very difficult to hire if your business is about:

- tracking people for analytics, whether online or offline
- cryptocurrencies, NFTs, blockchains
- awkwardly using Machine Learning for a problem it doesn't fit, and with ethically questionable outcomes

Other things I find repulsive include:

- requesting for me to move abroad without real necessity
- keeping people who are long out of uni on the crappy work contract with 7 day notice period (umowa-zlecenie)
- contacting me after hours
- batch emails for jobs that don't actually make sense for my profile
- contract clauses that break EU or Polish laws
- tax advisory companies that push the detective work of how to fulfill requirements for getting hired on me under pretense of it being obviously easy
- working with people whose brand is being playfully offensive all the time

### Afterword

If you have read all (or at least most) of this, and you don't see anything conflicting with what you want to offer me, you are free to contact me over [my Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/michcioperz/), at the email address listed in the [Contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) page, or you can build your custom email address for contacting me by putting your company's name before the @ sign and michcioperz.com after the @ sign. I'm going to do that anyway if you contact me at the public email address, so you might as well get ahead and do that if you want.
