This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). I'm not sure I trust the computer to do its job, but the date up here in the headline should theoretically be when this page was last updated.

### Physics

If we haven't met since the Before Times, it's likely that my hair volume has quadrupled and I now look like an arguably cute mess. It's unlikely that I've gotten taller, but if we meet, you will still tell me that I have.

### Geography

I live in moderately western Warsaw, Poland. I'm now triple vaxxed, so I'm open to suggestions of hanging out, though still with preference of walks on fresh air.

### Society

I'm in the final year of Masters degree at U of Warsaw, doing Computer Science. My thesis paper has me contributing to a cycle-accurate emulator of an off-the-shelf microcontroller, which is kinda interesting.

I'm looking for a job to start after I finish my degree. [Here's more about what I'm looking for](./careers)

### Chemistry

I was radicalized by a Tom Scott video and YouTube algorithms into buying a V60 coffee drip brewer and learning about speciality coffee after almost entirely avoiding it for years. I think in some sense I'm doing this to try and force myself into a daily ritual. We'll see how that goes.
