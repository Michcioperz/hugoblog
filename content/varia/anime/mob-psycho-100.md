### What is it?

A very stylish series about a boy with extremely developed esper powers and his struggle with normal life, occasionally interjected by villains attacking him.

### What's so great about it?

The main character's ways of thinking and the character development of everybody.

### Is it safe for work?

I think it's rather the photosensitive content during the fights you need to worry about.
