Dynamic anime lists like MyAnimeList and Kitsu are good for storing progress in
watching anime, but I often find myself digging through my completed series
list trying to find something to recommend. No more!

## Yuru CampΔ (Laid-Back Camp)

Slice of life series about cute girls doing camping things. I consider it my
anime of the year 2018. It is very much in the iyashikei territory, very comfy.
I much recommend the soundtrack by Akiyuki Tateyama.

## 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes in like a lion)

Mostly slice of life with a bit of sports, but the kind of sports I can relate
to – shogi. Also pretty comfy.

## Mob Psycho 100

Supernatural action and personal self-improvement. Very rich visually, but also
great character development.

## Kemurikusa

I don't really know how to explain why I like it. TODO

## Golden Kamuy

Adventure series set between the World Wars. Part-time comfy and part-time epic
action and part-time borderline disgusting. Overall a great watch.

## Devilman: Crybaby

Lewd ad nauseam, for well justified plot reasons. Drastic, especially towards
the end. Great story.

## Neo Yokio

Self-conscious.

## Planet With

Good mecha anime with nice designs and relatable message.

## Hinamatsuri

A moving supernatural comedy.

## Re:Creators

Cool action with cool story. My anime of the year 2017.

## Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge (Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)

Slice of life iyashikei about laziness. Life goals.

## Gatchaman Crowds

TODO description

## Hyouka

Mystery TODO

## Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun (Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun)

Light high school romcom

## Kino no Tabi (Kino's Journey)

There are two options for watching this, the 2003 series or the 2017 series.
Both are good, but in different styles. The older has a raw style comparable to
Serial Experiments Lain, the newer is more sparkling. As far as I remember they
mostly cover different parts of the source material, and it's great stories all
along.
